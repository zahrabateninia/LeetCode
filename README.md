# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to some LeetCode questions , especially essential problems for coding interviews and practice. I've implemented, and am continuing to implement, all solutions in my favorite programming languages which are Python and JS :)


## Repository Structure

Each solution in this repository is stored in a separate file named after the LeetCode problem it solves. For example, the solution to the "Two Sum" problem is in a file named `twoSum.py`.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my personal progress through the LeetCode challenges, suggestions and improvements are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.


Happy Coding!
