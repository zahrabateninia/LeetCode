# You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is 
# the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in 
# left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

# Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits):
        n = len(digits)
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if digits[i] < 9:
                digits[i] += 1
                return digits
            digits[i] = 0  # carry over
        
        return [1] + [0] * n
