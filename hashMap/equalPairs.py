# Equal Row and Column Pairs

# Given a 0-indexed n x n integer matrix grid, return the number of pairs (ri, cj) such that row ri and column cj are equal.
# A row and column pair is considered equal if they contain the same elements in the same order (i.e., an equal array).

grid = [[3,2,1],[1,7,6],[2,7,7]]
# Output should be 1
def equalPairs(grid) -> int:


# I have already the rows as arrays in grid array
# what I need: columns
